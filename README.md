Key features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on CFPB complaint dataset

Data cleaning and preprocessing for quality embeddings

Text chunking and embeddings with Sentence Transformers

Vector store indexing using FAISS

RAG pipeline for question answering

Interactive web interface via Streamlit/Gradio
